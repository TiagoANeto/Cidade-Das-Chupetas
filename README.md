# City-of-Pacifiers
Developed at the request of a pediatric dentistry graduate student, 'City of Pacifiers' is a game designed to encourage children aged 0 to 5 to give up their pacifiers. It achieves this through an educational approach throughout the gameplay. The application was used as a thesis for the completion of a postgraduate degree.
